# Verifying texture bias in ResNet-50

Testing results of [ImageNet-trained CNNs are biased towards texture; increasing shape bias improves accuracy and robustness](https://openreview.net/forum?id=Bygh9j09KX).

Accuracy of **results are as reported** with a reasonable margin of error.

The predictions of the **models are biased as described** in the paper.

**Thank you** to [Robert Geirhos](https://github.com/rgeirhos) for helping me reproduce the results.
